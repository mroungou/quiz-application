# quiz-application
Building a quiz application using Python.

Hello Dear reader,

In this project I want to create an application for doing quizzes. I am stats and economics tutor at
Concordia University in Montreal, Canada and each semester I do mock exams with students to prepare for exams,
and I would like the students to use this application to practice for their exams. It would include questions from different chapters, and if they get the answer wrong they would be able to
get hints on how to answer the question.

I would also like to include some sort of statistics in this quiz application. Which questions students often get wrong, which they get correct. This would help me as a tutor and my collegues focus
on those concepts that are challenging for students.


By the end of the semester I would like this application to be complete - the backend and the frontend of the app.
